# LastFM_Finder
Developed in Python in a single afternoon, this OSX app uses the Last.FM API to discover artists you've previously listened to, but who do not currently exist in your iTunes library.

## Important notice
Please be aware, this was an experimental project primarily designed to learn the Python programming language. As such, it is **unstable** and likely suffers from **compatibility issues**.

## Requirements
* Last.FM user account
* iTunes 11+

## Instructions
1. Download the application from the _app_ folder, zipped and unzipped versions are available 
2. Enter your Last.FM user account login details in the boxes marked _Username_ and _Password_
* Optional: Use the _Min. scrobbles_ filter to adjust the minimum number of times you must have scrobbled an artist on Last.FM for it to be included. (Default: 10)
3. Click _Browse for Library file_ and select your _iTunes Music Library.xml_ file. (By default this is located in ~/YOURNAME/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml)
4. Hit _Find missing artists_ to begin the comparison. Your results will follow shortly.

## Future changes
As this is an old experiment, there are currently no plans to continue developing it.
